            <strong>  Lets head towards my education :-  </strong><br> <br>
            I was always 'The' guy of my class, always had false pride of the same, which i regret <br>
            the most. I ended up scoring 94.83% in 10th standard which gave me an opportunity to  <br>
            continue my studies in a well reputed boarding school in Indore city. That's where my   <br>
            IIT journey started. During my JEE days i was damn competitive. I became studious kinda   <br>
            person, did not enjoyed that time. In short I ruined my school life from there onwards.  <br>
            I was not focussed toward boards so i could just secure 89.60% in 12th standard. I don't   <br>
            want to give excuses but my studies weren't enough, so I was not able to get a desired   <br>
            rank. I decided to try for 1 more year and I NAILED JEE THIS TIME  <br>
            <br>

            presently I am at this heaven. (Though i hate rainy season there)
